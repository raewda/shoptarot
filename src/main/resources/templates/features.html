        <br>Tarot is not just a set of cards, but a whole system of symbols and archetypes that have been formed over the centuries and imbued with deep philosophical and mystical traditions. The first mentions of Tarot cards date back to the 15th century in Italy, where they were used in games and social entertainment. However, over time, their purpose changed, and Tarot became a powerful tool for self-knowledge, predicting the future and, most valuable, for deep reflection on human nature and life paths.
        <br>
        <br>Each card in the Tarot deck is filled with unique meaning and symbolism, embodying a wide range of emotions and experiences. Arcana - both Minor and Major - represent key stages and concepts that help to understand internal and external challenges. For many people, Tarot has become not only a practical tool, but also a source of inspiration, allowing them to look inside themselves and find answers to important questions.
        <br>
        <br>The emotional value of Tarot lies in its ability to evoke feelings, make you think and open up new perspectives. Working with cards helps to connect with intuition, deepen understanding of yourself and the world around you. Each layout is not just a set of predictions for the future, but an opportunity to rethink the past and actively shape the present.
        <br>
